Later planning to move the legs sprite to make Sans dodge. The connected the leg sprite to one point and made the body move along the (Math.sin(Time.time*2), Math.sin(Time.time*2)). Made the head move more intensely with Time.time*4. Did same thing for Frisk.</center></td></tr>

Made gaster blasters shoot three directions from the same location so that it looks like a bomb. made puppies(planning to change to bone) move in a sin(Time.time) line horizontally. Planning to add this wave to another wave.</center></td></tr>

		<tr><td><center>Created another wave implementing the previous wave. Made bones go to player following the sin(Time.time*3) line vertically and added the blaster bomb. Also made blasters shoot vertically while moving right and left slowly by creating a variable "moveX" and adding it to the blaster's X position and changing the "moveX" if the blaster goes off the screen. So proud of myself.</center></td></tr>

Can't seem to access the blue soul's Dir() variable from another script, and unable to make the table containing the gray bone work. Needs more work.</center></td></tr>

		<tr><td><center>Working on Sans's and Frisk's dodge animation. Made another script, but as it does not connect to the original encounter script, just moved it to the Encounter script. Tried to access the HandleAttack() function, but as the legs(which are the parent sprite of the body, arms, and head) are connected to the encounter script and the HandleAttack() function is in the sans.lua script, can't integrate the dodge animation. Need more work. Additionally, trying to make items work. Heals one time, but does not disappear and the turn does not end. Need more work.</center></td></tr>

		<tr><td><center>Hardest work done. Made the Gaster Blaster shoot at player. As the blaster is spawned with blaster.New(spawn.x, spawn.y, move.x, move.y, direction), I used the Inverse Tangent function to make the blaster follow player. Got tangent with (Player.x - Blasters.x)/(Player.y - Blaster.y), and used Math.atan() to get the direction. Works successfully. Rewarded myself with a piece of chocolate.</center></td></tr>
