		<td><img src="sean.png" width="588" height="400"></td><td>I'm Sean Choi, currently a 7th grade student in JLS middle school.<br> I have a lot of interesting in creating art and coding.<br> I also love the game Undertale very much, and I decided to create the AU Morph!tale based on it. <br>I started coding with Scratch when I was in 3rd grade.<br> Then, I played Undertale and was so impressed that I decided to recreate it in Scratch.<br> However, it was near-impossible to create the system in Scratch(as I had to keep track of all files with lists and stuff)<br> so I moved on to scripting. First started Python, then tried Unity, then HTML and Javascript.<br> I'm still experimenting with a lot of stuff, but I'm currently happy with CYF, and engine made by RTL, <br>and I'm drawing the comic and coding the game for Morph!tale!</td>
